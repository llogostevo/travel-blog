## A Riverside Run and Cologne's Charms

From the moment I stepped out of the Cologne Central Station and the towering presence of the Cologne Cathedral greeted me, I knew the day would be special. This Gothic masterpiece, a UNESCO World Heritage site, has been a silent witness to the city's rich history, spanning over seven centuries.

However, before delving into the architectural and historical wonders of the city, I laced up my running shoes for a morning run. The Rhine, with its tranquil waters and bustling promenade, offered the perfect backdrop. Starting at the Hohenzollern Bridge, I made my way down the riverbank, the iconic skyline of Cologne unfolding with every step. The sun reflecting off the waters, the distant sound of the cathedral's bells, and the rhythmic beat of my footsteps created a symphony that's hard to put into words.

Post-run, a hearty breakfast at a local café recharged me, and I ventured into the charming Old Town. Winding alleys, historic brew houses, and vibrant squares like the Alter Markt made me feel as if I'd stepped back in time. No visit to Cologne is complete without sampling its famous Kölsch beer, and a local Brauhaus provided just that opportunity.

As the sun began to set, I found myself back by the Rhine, this time on a leisurely boat cruise, taking in the mesmerizing views of the city from a different perspective.

From the morning's refreshing run to a deep dive into Cologne's history and culture, the day was nothing short of magical.
