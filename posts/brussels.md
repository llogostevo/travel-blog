## Day 1: Touchdown in Brussels
Brussels, known for its medieval town squares and rich gastronomy, had always intrigued me. Last month, I embarked on a week-long journey to discover the heart of Belgium.

As my flight approached Brussels Airport, the silhouette of the Atomium—an iconic building and museum—glistened in the distance, signaling my arrival in the city. Once settled in my hotel near the Grand-Place, I was eager to roam the cobbled streets. Brussels greeted me with its mix of Gothic architecture, bustling cafés, and the aroma of waffles wafting through the air. For dinner, I couldn't resist the classic moules-frites (mussels and fries) at a traditional Belgian brasserie.

## Day 2: Art, History, and Chocolate

The day began with a journey through time at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, where I admired masterpieces by famous artists such as Magritte and Bruegel. Venturing through the Sablon district, the numerous chocolate shops beckoned, each promising a taste of Belgium's finest chocolates. Unable to resist, I indulged in a chocolate tasting session.

Later, I wandered to the Manneken Pis, a small bronze statue that, though modest in size, holds significant cultural importance in Brussels. My day concluded with a visit to the Belgian Comic Strip Center, a testament to Belgium's significant contribution to the comic art form.
